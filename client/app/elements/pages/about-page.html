    <p>
      Hivelife is the first free record keeping application for beekeepers. The application allows you to create apiaries, store information about hives, fill out inspections, and even log harvests. With Hivelife, you can even have friends, family, or coworkers be involved in your apiary, allowing you all to keep and view records in one single place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When logging data in Hivelife, you have the option to make that data available in our data portal. Identification information associated with your apiary is stripped away, but data related to hives, inspections, and harvests can be downloaded by the public. This data will be made available in the public domain (Creative Commons â€“ Attribution, Non-commercial, Share-alike) for anyone to use in our data portal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When released from beta, this prject will be open sourced under the GNU General Public License version 3. The code can be available on GitHub. This will allow users to host their own version of Hivelife and allow the community to help add in features and fix bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like any other software, Hivelife will always be incomplete. Feature requests, suggestions, and other feedback are appreciated. Contact information can be found over at our contact page.
